I am making this page for fun, for learning tools, for holding random things, for you to get to know me.

I am currently a senior at Haverford College. I was born in Osaka, Japan and grew up in Shanghai, China, one of the best cities in my opinion. I major in Physics with a concentration in sceintific computing, but I also have a heart for history, for reading texts to learn about communities and people in the past. Out side books and studying, I play ultimate frisbee, run, occasionally bake and knit.
